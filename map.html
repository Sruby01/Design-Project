        <td>There are many ways to get from point A to point B in this school but it's hard to avoid large crowds and busy areas. Here are some tips to get around:
        <p>1) There is a speedy way to get to the music area and the B wing - in the middle of the student services area, there is a small but always empty hallway so it can save you some precious time.</p>2) Auditorium intersection. There are doors everywhere in Auditorium leading to the upstairs and downstairs floors alike. So, if you don't mind weaving around chairs, you can avoid going up any of the actual stairs.<p>3) Finally, if there isn't a specific reason to go down, avoid the basement at all costs! There are no short cuts or time savers, so just avoid it.</p></td>
