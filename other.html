        <td style="width: 85%;"><b>Cafeteria:</b> The truth about the cafeteria is that some of the food is good and some of it isn't. On one hand, there is always a line up for the cookies and the drinks but in my opinion, the salads and some of the meal options seem to come straight out of a "Diary of the Wimpy Kid" book. The best advice I can give you is to pay close attention to the weekly menu so you know when it is safe to line up for caf food and when you should bring a sandwich from home!</td>

        <td style="width: 85%;"><b>Off campus:</b> For kids in Sec 3 or above, there's plenty of places to go when it comes to the surrounding area of the school. There are 3 deps within walking distance. If you want to go a bit further, then you can walk down to the Saint Laurent River and in the opposite direction is Terra Cotta Park. </td>

        <td style="width: 85%;"><b>Teachers:</b> If I'm being honest, St. Thomas has some great teachers but they are pretty inconsistent with the rules. Some are lenient when it comes to punishment, while others will give you a week of detention if they so much as smell a phone in their class. So, the only trick here is to wait until someone else messes up and learn from their mistakes. Finally, if you do get in trouble, remember that even the the meanist teachers are a little bit nicer the first time you mess up. </td>
